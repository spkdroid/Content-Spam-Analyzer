# Content-Spam-Analyzer

<h4>Content Spam Analyzer is a tool that rates a web page based on following attributes using the content present inside it</h4>

1) Word Count <br>
2) Number of Anchor Tags<br>
3) Visibility Ratio<br>
4) Compression Ratio<br>
5) Content in the Title Text<br>
6) Popular Word Ratio<br>
7) Average Word Length.<br>

Based on the 7 Test that is performed by the page our analyzer program will give a score back to you.

Based on the score you can have an idea about weather the give page is spam or not.

We are working on Naive Bayes Model for the prediction part which will be updated soon.
