Who we are:</b>
<P>
Labyrinth is home to a couple working class stiffs who are just trying to be the
best they can be. This is just a place to hang our pages. We feel its better
than some lame web-hosting site that makes you throw their annoying banners
up on your pages, or charges you for no tech-support, slow access, and space
on a dusty old server in the corner of their computer shop&#133;
<P>
We do not espouse any sort of religious or philosophical views. You won't
find guides to puzzles, mazes or labyrinths here. You won't find any peace,
enlightenment or harmony perusing these pages. You might find a link or two
worth checking out, or learn something about some of us.<P>
If you are looking for something along these lines, I recommend trying out <A HREF="http://www.labyrinths.org/">LabyrinthS.org</a> instead.

Why "Labyrinth"?</b>
<P>
Why not?&nbsp; If you look at the InterNIC registry, you will note that this domain
was registered in 1995. We thought the name was cool and decided it would
fit with who we were at the time. Since we all worked in the Industry at
the time, it would have been easy to come up with any name and register it&#133;
after all, the Internet back then was a shadow of what it is today. I guess
if we were going to blame someone, it would be my buddy Mike&#133; he came up with
the name, and it was his site originally.

Blog for 2005:</b>
<P>
I am running this site off my own server these days.  Sysadmin stuff is kind of cool, and I am always into learning something new.  It amazes me how many people have no clue what they're doing tho, when it comes to anything technical.  I have people beating on my webserver all the time, infected with code-red, even though this was 4 years ago.  PATCH YOUR DANG MACHINES PEOPLE!!!  It is getting old.<P>
I read the other day about how there's over a million zombie machines out there now, all because people who have no business owning computers, have them, and a company named Microsoft has sold every one of them a drug called Windows.  This drug makes people feel good while they use the Internet but makes them give up their financial, personal, and other confidential information in exchange for that "good surfing experience".  
<P>
The funniest part of the whole thing is that Microsoft has gone through the effort of snowballing a bunch of really big companies into using their drug too.  So, now when you use these company's websites, your information is shared with all sorts of people you have no intention of giving it to.  Isn't that just great?
<P>The worst part here is that the PC hardware manufacturers have been controlled by Microsoft for so long they don't develop for anything else.  So, chances are, if you're an average joe trying to use the Internet, you're not going to bother loading anything other than Windows (such as Linux) because he's not going to be able to figure out all the little tricks to get something else working.<P>
If you haven't figured it out yet people, there is a monopoly here, and we're the victims.  Write your representatives, take a stand, make some noise, choose not to be a victim, and break the monopoly!  If enough of us make noise about this, something will happen!
