                <br>
                <span class="orangetext">Vacation is a time to relax and recharge, 
                not stress. Keep your trip simple, safe, and rejuvenating with 
                these secrets from a travel expert</span></p>
              <p><span class="greytext">It's time to get some warmth back into 
                your life by finding the closest thing to paradise your 1-week 
                vacation will allow. Here's how to keep your trip simple and safe 
                as you jet off to find your place in the sun. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Don't pack to impress. </strong>Plan to leave formal wear 
                at home. Not only do you lighten your suitcase, you keep your 
                clothes choices to a minimum, which helps take a load off your 
                mind and puts you more in vacation mode. These days, most restaurants 
                and clubs welcome the relaxed, informal look, anyway. A few well-coordinated 
                outfits in dark colors should get you through any dinner or event. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Dodge airport hang-ups.</strong> The shortest distance 
                between two points is a straight line, so keep yourself out of 
                long, twisting queues by planning your flight well in advance 
                of your trip. Find out when your airport of choice is busiest, 
                and avoid traveling on those days, says Susan Tanzman, president 
                of Martin's Travel and Tours in Los Angeles. Then plan arriving 
                at the airport well in advance of your flight just for the heck 
                of it. "It's easier to get there early and not be hassled," says 
                Tanzman. "So if the lines are long, or if something goes wrong, 
                you're not stressed out, which is the worst way to start a vacation." 
                <br>
                <br>
                To glide through airport security, Tanzman recommends leaving 
                the bulk of your jewelry at home. Not only can it set off alarms 
                at security checkpoints, but it can attract thieves both in airports 
                and at destinations. Don't wear shoes that have metal components 
                (some are made with steel shanks), and be sure to wear socks, 
                since you'll probably have to take off your shoes for security 
                personnel. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Have fun in the sun wisely. </strong>Once you've landed 
                at your destination, apply the sunscreen (SPF of at least 15 for 
                you and 30 for the kids). Reapply sunscreen after swimming, sweating, 
                vigorous activity, or toweling dry. <br>
                <br>
                Remember that certain activities, such as snorkeling, expose your 
                skin to the sun in unusual ways. Floating face-down exposes your 
                back, neck, arms, and legs to direct sun, and the reflective, 
                prism-like water concentrates the rays even more as you kick and 
                swim. Apply sunscreen generously to such forgotten spots as wrists, 
                heels, and behind your knees. For more sun-safety tips, visit 
                <a href="http://www.coppertone.com">www.coppertone.com</a>. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Take allergy precautions. </strong>Allergens are everywhere, 
                and they can wreak havoc on your plans unless you take some precautions. 
                So pack an "allergy bag" with an adequate supply of non-drowsy 
                Claritin&reg; allergy products. (Use as directed.) And before 
                arriving at your destination, make sure amenities are available 
                for you in case you need to take a break from the outdoors if 
                your allergy symptoms flare up. <br>
                <br>
                If you are staying in a hotel or resort, ask for a nonsmoking 
                room and eat in smoke-free restaurants. And don't forget to request 
                a smoke-free rental car. Cigarette smoke is one of the most common 
                irritants and can aggravate allergy symptoms. Also, remove any 
                feather pillows in your hotel room, and bring or ask for synthetic 
                pillows instead.<br>

              <p><span class="greytext">School's out, and summer&mdash;the season 
                of the great outdoors&mdash;has officially arrived. But what do 
                you do if your child would rather surf the Web than run through 
                the sprinkler or go for a hike? <br>
                <br>
                Glenn Snelbecker, professor of educational psychology at Temple 
                University, says parents need to encourage kids to strike a good 
                balance between online and outside fun. "Things done in excess, 
                even good things, can be a problem," he says. "And there are many 
                ways to combine computer activities and more active things." Parents 
                just need to find ways to make the activities attractive. Here 
                are a few ideas to help bring about balance in your household. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Go on a treasure hunt. </strong>About 6 years ago, a new, 
                informal treasure-hunting sport called letterboxing migrated to 
                the US from Great Britain. The object of the hunt is to find letterboxes, 
                which are usually hidden in natural areas such as parks. Inside 
                the box, you'll find a notebook, a unique stamp, and a stamp pad. 
                Stamp the notebook inside the box with your personal stamp. Ta-da! 
                You were here! Then stamp your own letterboxing notebook with 
                the stamp you find in the box. Nearly 4,000 boxes are planted 
                across the US and in Canada&mdash;that's a lot of stamps to collect! 
                <br>
                <strong><br>
                The Internet connection: </strong>You can find loads of clues 
                to existing letterboxes online. One particularly good site: <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org" target="_blank">www.letterboxing.org</a>. 
                The site also has tips for setting up new boxes and a section 
                for adding clues. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Get in touch with nature. </strong>Challenge your child 
                to find and classify 10 different animals in your backyard or 
                in a local park. After a few hours or even a day of searching 
                and snapping photos outside, encourage him to use online sites 
                such as the Audubon Society (www.audubon.org) and the US Fish 
                and Wildlife Service (<a href="http://www.fws.gov" target="_blank">www.fws.gov</a>) 
                to attach names to his discoveries. <br>
                <br>
                Also, have your child check out the National Wildlife Federation's 
                Kidzone (<a href="http://www.nwf.org/kids" target="_blank">www.nwf.org/kids</a>) 
                to learn how to create a flourishing habitat for wildlife in your 
                own backyard. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Plan a trip or activity. </strong>Have your child plan 
                a summer excursion&mdash;whether it's a day trip, a weekend vacation, 
                or even a simple family game. With the Internet at his fingertips, 
                researching sports game schedules, museum hours, and even arts 
                and craft ideas is simple and fun. <br>
                <br>
                For starters, the President's E-Government Initiative (<a href="http://www.recreation.gov" target="_blank">www.recreation.gov</a>) 
                offers tons of information on organized hikes, sports games for 
                all ages, and other outdoor activities. For older kids, sites 
                such as Mapquest (<a href="http://www.mapquest.com" target="_blank">www.mapquest.com</a>) 
                and Yahoo! Maps (<a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">www.yahoo.com</a>) 
                offer driving directions and directories for regional attractions.
